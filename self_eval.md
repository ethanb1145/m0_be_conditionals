# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? It's useful to test for certain requirements such as checking to make sure there is enough characters in a password.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? I would put a little more detail in how the process goes in comparison, I wasn't really sure how to be more specfic.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? I was able to minimize the amount of code needed for the challenge problem by simply using the "or" statement and the "else" statement. I was able to only have a couple lines of code instead of putting a lot of "elsif" statements.
